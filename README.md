Covid-19-Analysis-and-Future-Forecasting

The purpose of this project is to predit the latest trends of covid-19 in different provinces of Pakistan. Moreover, using the data available I have then predicted the number of positive cases to be expected in two provinces of Pakistan for the upcoming 10 days. Using these predictions I have calculated the positivity rate in provinces.
